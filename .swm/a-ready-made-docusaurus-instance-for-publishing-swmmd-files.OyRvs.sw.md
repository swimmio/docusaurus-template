name: A Ready-Made Docusaurus Instance For Publishing swm.md Files
file_version: 1.0.2

This repo contains an initialized [docs-only Docusaurus instance](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction#docs-only-mode) for publishing Swimm documentation. The tutorial on how to do it is found in the `ðŸ“„ README.md` file.

Maintaining this means just keeping it up-to-date with the Docusaurus v2 beta. Since this is a template, we don't commit package-lock files, just be sure `ðŸ“„ package.json` stays up-to-date with their development.
